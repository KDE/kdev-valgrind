? Fix crash when cachegrind tool called (now works without crash).

- Add global setting for separate (or current as now) valgrind tools in the "Analyze" menu.

- Add settings for cg_annotate/callgrind_annotate arguments

- Unimplemented tools: helgrind

+ Move executables paths settings from launch configuration to global (KDevelop) config page and
  use KConfig for global settings.

+ Remove KCachegrind launch from cachegrind tool (as useless)
